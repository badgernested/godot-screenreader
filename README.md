# Godot Screenreader

Work in progress.

Inspired by the work of [LightsOutGames](https://github.com/lightsoutgames/godot-accessibility), who created the first Godot accessibility plugin for Godot 3.x, and [rodolpheh](https://github.com/rodolpheh/godot-accessibility), who converted LightsOutGames' plugin to be used for Godot 4.x.
