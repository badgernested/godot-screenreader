Menu manager built by PunishedFelix ("badgernested"). Also added some additional functionality.

Note: I decided to rewrite the main UI node interface because I was deeply unsatisfied with 
Godot's implementation of the focus properties. These changes include:
	- Adding a navigation tree allowing users to navigate the UI predictably
	- Sound effects, such as the typewriter sound effects.
	- Verbose mode, which allows users to hear more information.

Initial TTS Godot plugin built by LightsOutGames, Godot 4.x version built by rodolpheh.

All sound effects are CC0 and found on freesound.org.
